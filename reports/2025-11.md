### ToolScope: An Agentic Framework for Vision-Guided and Long-Horizon Tool Use

**Authors:** Mengjie Deng, Guanting Dong, Zhicheng Dou

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27363

**Motivation:**

Enabling MLLMs to flexibly use external tools for long-horizon vision-guided reasoning without visual context degradation.

**Method:**

ToolScope integrates global planning and local multimodal perception via a Perceive tool, with a Navigator, Executor, and Synthesizer architecture.

**Abstract:**

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains, including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up to +6.69% across all datasets.

**Authors:** Weijian Jian, Yajun Zhang, Dawei Liang, Chunyu Xie, Yixiao He, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27350

**Motivation:**

Extending multimodal retrieval beyond natural images to support videos and visual documents within a unified framework.

**Method:**

RzenEmbed uses a two-stage training strategy with a hardness-weighted InfoNCE loss and noise mitigation to learn cross-modal embeddings.

**Abstract:**

The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images, offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements. Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch. Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities. We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available in https://huggingface.co/qihoo360/RzenEmbed.

### FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding

**Authors:** Zirui Zhu, Hailun Xu, Yang Luo, Yong Liu, Kanchan Sarkar, Zhenheng Yang, Yang You

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27280

**Motivation:**

Efficiently selecting informative keyframes from long videos under strict token budgets for scalable MLLM-based understanding.

**Method:**

FOCUS frames keyframe selection as a combinatorial bandit problem, using confidence bounds to balance exploration and exploitation in two stages.

**Abstract:**

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

### Can MLLMs Read the Room? A Multimodal Benchmark for Verifying Truthfulness in Multi-Party Social Interactions

**Authors:** Caixin Kang, Yifei Huang, Liangyang Ouyang, Mingfang Zhang, Yoichi Sato

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27195

**Motivation:**

Assessing MLLMs’ ability to detect truthfulness in multi-party social interactions using verbal and non-verbal cues.

**Method:**

Introduces the MIVA task and a Werewolf-based dataset with synchronized video/text and ground-truth labels to benchmark MLLM veracity assessment.

**Abstract:**

As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

### TIR-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Agentic Thinking-with-Images Reasoning

**Authors:** Ming Li, Jike Zhong, Shitian Zhao, Haoquan Zhang, Shaoheng Lin, Yuxiang Lai, Wei Chen, Konstantinos Psounis, Kaipeng Zhang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01833

**Motivation:**

Existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate advanced agentic visual reasoning that involves dynamic tool use for image manipulation in chain-of-thought.

**Method:**

Introduces TIR-Bench, a benchmark with 13 diverse tasks requiring novel image-processing tools, and evaluates 22 MLLMs to assess true thinking-with-images capabilities.

**Abstract:**

The frontier of visual reasoning is shifting toward models like OpenAI o3, which can intelligently create and operate tools to transform images for problem-solving, also known as thinking-\textit{with}-images in chain-of-thought. Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced capability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current thinking-\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as localization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic, and tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks, each requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in chain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from leading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use augmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and strong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities. Finally, we present a pilot study comparing direct versus agentic fine-tuning.

### Actial: Activate Spatial Reasoning Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models

**Authors:** Xiaoyu Zhan, Wenxuan Huang, Hao Sun, Xinyu Fu, Changfeng Ma, Shaosheng Cao, Bohan Jia, Shaohui Lin, Zhenfei Yin, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Yuanqi Li, Jie Guo, Yanwen Guo

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01618

**Motivation:**

MLLMs lack robust spatial reasoning for 3D tasks, particularly cross-view consistency, limiting their real-world applicability in robotics and scene understanding.

**Method:**

Proposes Viewpoint Learning with a 100K-image dataset and a two-stage fine-tuning strategy—SFT followed by GRPO reinforcement learning—to enhance spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

**Abstract:**

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved 2D visual understanding, prompting interest in their application to complex 3D reasoning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these models can effectively capture the detailed spatial information required for robust real-world performance, especially cross-view consistency, a key requirement for accurate 3D reasoning. Considering this issue, we introduce Viewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We present the Viewpoint-100K dataset, consisting of 100K object-centric image pairs with diverse viewpoints and corresponding question-answer pairs. Our approach employs a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: first, foundational knowledge is injected to the baseline MLLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on Viewpoint-100K, resulting in significant improvements across multiple tasks; second, generalization is enhanced through Reinforcement Learning using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm on a broader set of questions. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid cold-start initialization method designed to simultaneously learn viewpoint representations and maintain coherent reasoning thinking. Experimental results show that our approach significantly activates the spatial reasoning ability of MLLM, improving performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Our findings highlight the value of developing foundational spatial skills in MLLMs, supporting future progress in robotics, autonomous systems, and 3D scene understanding.

### Explore More, Learn Better: Parallel MLLM Embeddings under Mutual Information Minimization

**Authors:** Zhicheng Wang, Chen Ju, Xu Chen, Shuai Xiao, Jinsong Lan, Xiaoyong Zhu, Ying Chen, Zhiguo Cao

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01588

**Motivation:**

Standard embedding paradigms collapse multifaceted inputs into single embeddings, underutilizing MLLMs’ capacity for diverse, rich representations.

**Method:**

Presents a Parallel Decoupling Framework that uses learnable prefixes and mutual information minimization to generate diverse, semantically aligned parallel embeddings from one MLLM.

**Abstract:**

Embedding models are a cornerstone of modern AI. Driven by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have made great progress in architecture and data curation, while the holistic paradigm is still limited to SSC, i.e., single input, singular embedding, contrastive supervision, which collapses rich, multifaceted inputs into monolithic embeddings and fails to fully exploit MLLM capabilities. In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF) for multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of MLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response under explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone on distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one input, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote full parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an explicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain semantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic coverage and a generalizable embedding space. Ultimately, the remarkable embedding space are accessible at inference via one single forward pass, incurring negligible computational overhead. We instantiate PDF on multiple MLLM backbones and prove its effectiveness on MMEB benchmark. Significant gains are consistently achieved across various resolutions and model sizes, e.g., boosting the VLM2Vec-LLaVA-1.6-LR model by a remarkable +8.9% (7B), while the VLM2Vec-Qwen2VL models by +4.2% (2B) and +3.1% (7B). In terms of efficiency, our 2B model surpasses its baseline by +2.6% using only half the computational budget.

### UniREditBench: A Unified Reasoning-based Image Editing Benchmark

**Authors:** Feng Han, Yibin Wang, Chenglin Li, Zheming Liang, Dianyi Wang, Yang Jiao, Zhipeng Wei, Chao Gong, Cheng Jin, Jingjing Chen, Jiaqi Wang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01295

**Motivation:**

Current image editing benchmarks neglect complex reasoning scenarios like multi-object interactions and game-world rules, and rely solely on textual evaluation.

**Method:**

Introduces UniREditBench with 2,700 samples across real and game-world settings, multimodal dual-reference evaluation, and a synthetic CoT-annotated dataset for training and benchmarking.

**Abstract:**

Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have driven substantial improvements in image editing. However, current generative models still struggle with handling diverse and complex image editing tasks that require implicit reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess their performance across various reasoning scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-object attribute transformation in realistic scenarios, which, while effective, encounter two key challenges: (1) they largely overlook multi-object interactions as well as game-world scenarios that involve human-defined rules, which are common in real-life applications; (2) they only rely on textual references to evaluate the generated images, potentially leading to systematic misjudgments, especially in complex reasoning scenarios. To this end, this work proposes UniREditBench, a unified benchmark for reasoning-based image editing evaluation. It comprises 2,700 meticulously curated samples, covering both real- and game-world scenarios across 8 primary dimensions and 18 sub-dimensions. To improve evaluation reliability, we introduce multimodal dual-reference evaluation, providing both textual and ground-truth image references for each sample assessment. Furthermore, we design an automated multi-scenario data synthesis pipeline and construct UniREdit-Data-100K, a large-scale synthetic dataset with high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations. We fine-tune Bagel on this dataset and develop UniREdit-Bagel, demonstrating substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Through thorough benchmarking of both open-source and closed-source image editing models, we reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.

### Can Visual Input Be Compressed? A Visual Token Compression Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models

**Authors:** Tianfan Peng, Yuntao Du, Pengzhou Ji, Shijie Dong, Kailin Jiang, Mingchuan Ma, Yijun Tian, Jinhe Bi, Qian Li, Wei Du, Feng Xiao, Lizhen Cui

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02650

**Motivation:**

Addresses fragmented evaluation of visual token compression methods in large multimodal models, which suffer from inference inefficiency due to excessive visual tokens.

**Method:**

Introduces UniPruneBench, a unified benchmark evaluating ten compression algorithms across multiple models, tasks, and system-level metrics like latency and accuracy.

**Abstract:**

Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging, have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets, covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs (LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling.

### SAIL-RL: Guiding MLLMs in When and How to Think via Dual-Reward RL Tuning

**Authors:** Fangxun Shu, Yongjie Ye, Yue Liao, Zijian Kang, Weijie Yin, Jiacong Wang, Xiao Liang, Shuicheng Yan, Chao Feng

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02280

**Motivation:**

Existing MLLMs lack adaptive reasoning control, often overthinking simple tasks or underthinking complex ones, and rely only on outcome-based supervision.

**Method:**

Proposes SAIL-RL, a dual-reward RL framework that guides MLLMs on when to reason deeply and how to reason well using thinking and judging rewards.

**Abstract:**

We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward, which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-RL.

### QG-CoC: Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions for Large Multimodal Models

**Authors:** Kuei-Chun Kao, Hsu Tzu-Yin, Yunqi Hong, Ruochen Wang, Cho-Jui Hsieh

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03206

**Motivation:**

Addresses MLLMs' poor fine-grained perception and reasoning across multiple images, especially in general multi-image tasks beyond constrained scenarios.

**Method:**

Proposes QG-CoC, a zero-shot prompting method that uses question-guided chains of captions to integrate perception and reasoning across arbitrary numbers of images.

**Abstract:**

Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

### Cambrian-S: Towards Spatial Supersensing in Video

**Authors:** Shusheng Yang, Jihan Yang, Pinzhi Huang, Ellis Brown, Zihao Yang, Yue Yu, Shengbang Tong, Zihan Zheng, Yifan Xu, Muhan Wang, Daohan Lu, Rob Fergus, Yann LeCun, Li Fei-Fei, Saining Xie

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04670

**Motivation:**

Current multimodal systems lack true spatial understanding; they fail at deep 3D reasoning and predictive world modeling beyond basic perception.

**Method:**

Proposes spatial supersensing framework, introduces VSI-SUPER benchmark, trains Cambrian-S on VSI-590K, and explores predictive sensing via next-latent-frame prediction.

**Abstract:**

We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen), streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences), implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited, indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise (prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate, select, and organize experience.

### SIMS-V: Simulated Instruction-Tuning for Spatial Video Understanding

**Authors:** Ellis Brown, Arijit Ray, Ranjay Krishna, Ross Girshick, Rob Fergus, Saining Xie

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04668

**Motivation:**

Real-world spatial video data with precise annotations is scarce, limiting spatial reasoning in multimodal models.

**Method:**

Introduces SIMS-V, a simulation-based framework generating diverse spatially-rich training data; identifies key question types for efficient real-world transfer.

**Abstract:**

Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just 25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization, maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

### Benchmark Designers Should "Train on the Test Set" to Expose Exploitable Non-Visual Shortcuts

**Authors:** Ellis Brown, Jihan Yang, Shusheng Yang, Rob Fergus, Saining Xie

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04655

**Motivation:**

Multimodal benchmarks often contain non-visual shortcuts that models exploit, undermining evaluation of true visual understanding.

**Method:**

Proposes 'training on the test set' via Test-set Stress-Test and Iterative Bias Pruning to diagnose and remove non-visual biases from benchmarks.

**Abstract:**

Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be. Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns. We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology. Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing. Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an ``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider vision-blind performance gap than the original.

### PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning

**Authors:** Yicheng Xiao, Yu Chen, Haoxuan Ma, Jiale Hong, Caorui Li, Lingxiang Wu, Haiyun Guo, Jinqiao Wang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04601

**Motivation:**

CLIP struggles with fine-grained vision-language alignment due to limited textual granularity and fixed visual processing.

**Method:**

Presents PixCLIP: replaces CLIP’s text encoder with an LLM, uses pixel-level prompts and long-form descriptions from LongGRIT dataset for any-granularity alignment.

**Abstract:**

While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing, e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized, long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Thinking with Video: Video Generation as a Promising Multimodal Reasoning Paradigm

**Authors:** Jingqi Tong, Yurong Mou, Hangcheng Li, Mingzhe Li, Yongzhuo Yang, Ming Zhang, Qiguang Chen, Tianyi Liang, Xiaomeng Hu, Yining Zheng, Xinchi Chen, Jun Zhao, Xuanjing Huang, Xipeng Qiu

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04570

**Motivation:**

Existing reasoning paradigms using static images or separate text/vision modalities cannot capture dynamic processes or unified multimodal thought.

**Method:**

Introduces 'Thinking with Video' using video generation models like Sora-2; evaluates on VideoThinkBench showing strong performance on vision- and text-centric tasks.

**Abstract:**

"Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1) Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration, we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks, Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU. Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model, positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

### V-Thinker: Interactive Thinking with Images

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04460

**Motivation:**

Current LMMs lack general, interactive image-based reasoning over long horizons with flexible visual tool use.

**Method:**

Presents V-Thinker: uses a Data Evolution Flywheel and Visual Progressive Training Curriculum with reinforcement learning for end-to-end interactive visual reasoning.

**Abstract:**

Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs. To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1) a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing image-interactive reasoning applications.

### On the Brittleness of CLIP Text Encoders

**Authors:** Allie Tran, Luca Rossetto

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04247

**Motivation:**

CLIP text encoders are brittle—minor query perturbations cause large changes in retrieval results, harming reliability.

**Method:**

Systematically analyzes lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations on CLIP variants in video search tasks, revealing instability from surface-level edits.

**Abstract:**

Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space. However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark accuracy.

## When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning

**Authors:** Mi Luo, Zihui Xue, Alex Dimakis, Kristen Grauman
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06077

### motivation
Addresses 'visual thinking drift' where Chain-of-Thought reasoning in video tasks generates hallucinated or biased narratives ungrounded in visual evidence.

### method
Introduces Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a reinforcement learning framework that rewards reasoning traces verifiably grounded in actual video content.

### abstract
Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

## Gaussian Embeddings: How JEPAs Secretly Learn Your Data Density

**Authors:** Randall Balestriero, Nicolas Ballas, Mike Rabbat, Yann LeCun
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05949

### motivation
Reveals that the anti-collapse term in JEPAs implicitly learns data density, enabling probabilistic inference from self-supervised representations.

### method
Shows that JEPA-trained models can compute sample probabilities in closed-form using the Jacobian, yielding a density estimator called JEPA-SCORE.

### abstract
Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family (I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

## Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow

**Authors:** Ruyang Liu, Shangkun Sun, Haoran Tang, Ge Li, Wei Gao
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05836

### motivation
Tackles redundancy in long-form video understanding exacerbated by limited context in multimodal LLMs and overreliance on semantic priors like CLIP.

### method
Proposes Flow4Agent, which uses optical flow as a motion prior to optimize temporal granularity and prune redundant visual tokens efficiently.

### abstract
Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper, we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding. Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

## Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics for Visual Reasoning and Comprehension

**Authors:** Jike Zhong, Yuxiang Lai, Xiaofeng Yang, Konstantinos Psounis
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05674

### motivation
Bridges the gap between language and vision models in reasoning by addressing the lack of semantic context in standard vision transformer training.

### method
Replaces random patch masking with object-level masked image modeling to encourage learning of global semantics and contextual visual relationships.

### abstract
Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning

## Improving Chain-of-Thought Efficiency for Autoregressive Image Generation

**Authors:** Zeqi Gu, Markos Georgopoulos, Xiaoliang Dai, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Chu Wang, Felix Juefei-Xu, Kunpeng Li, Yujun Shi, Zecheng He, Zijian He, Jiawei Zhou, Abe Davis, Jialiang Wang
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05593

### motivation
Reduces computational inefficiency and prompt contradictions caused by verbose Chain-of-Thought reasoning in autoregressive image generation.

### method
Introduces ShortCoTI, a reinforcement learning framework that adaptively rewards concise CoT prompts while preserving image generation quality.

### abstract
Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images.

**Authors:** Chenfei Liao, Wensong Wang, Zichen Wen, Xu Zheng, Yiyu Wang, Haocong He, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Lutao Jiang, Xin Zou, Yuqian Fu, Bin Ren, Linfeng Zhang, Xuming Hu

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07143

### motivation
Current benchmarks for visual token compression are mismatched and noisy, leading to unfair evaluations of compression methods.

### method
Proposes VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework with data filtering to denoise benchmarks and enable fairer assessment of compression techniques.

### abstract
Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of visual token compression methods.

## SaFeR-VLM: Toward Safety-aware Fine-grained Reasoning in Multimodal Models

**Authors:** Huahui Yi, Kun Wang, Qiankun Li, Miao Yu, Liang Lin, Gongli Xi, Hao Wu, Xuming Hu, Kang Li, Yang Liu

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06871

### motivation
Multimodal reasoning models amplify safety risks during reasoning, and existing defenses fail to constrain the reasoning process itself.

### method
Introduces SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned RL framework embedding safety into reasoning via curated data, reflective rollouts, structured rewards, and GRPO optimization.

### abstract
Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

## SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals

**Authors:** Xuhang Chen, Zhifan Song, Deyi Ji, Shuo Gao, Lanyun Zhu

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06843

### motivation
Existing multi-LLM debate methods ignore internal self-signals, causing redundancy and inefficiency in collaborative reasoning.

### method
Presents SID, which uses model-level confidence and token-level attention to adaptively guide debate, enabling early exit and content compression.

### abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems.

## Get RICH or Die Scaling: Profitably Trading Inference Compute for Robustness

**Authors:** Tavish McDonald, Bo Lei, Stanislav Fort, Bhavya Kailkhura, Brian Bartoldson

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06790

### motivation
Test-time compute improves robustness only under limited attack settings; its value under gradient-based or multimodal attacks is unclear.

### method
Proposes the RICH hypothesis: inference compute boosts robustness when models leverage compositional generalization from robustified training data.

### abstract
Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks, resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH: attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

## DreamOmni2: Multimodal Instruction-based Editing and Generation

**Authors:** Bin Xia, Bohao Peng, Yuechen Zhang, Junjia Huang, Jiyang Liu, Jingyao Li, Haoru Tan, Sitong Wu, Chengyao Wang, Yitong Wang, Xinglong Wu, Bei Yu, Jiaya Jia

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06679

### motivation
Current instruction-based editing and subject-driven generation lack support for multimodal inputs and abstract concepts.

### method
Introduces DreamOmni2 with a data synthesis pipeline and a multimodal framework using index/position encoding and joint VLM training.

### abstract
Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1) using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

## ToolMem: Enhancing Multimodal Agents with Learnable Tool Capability Memory

**Authors:** Yunzhong Xiao, Yangmin Li, Hewei Wang, Yunlong Tang, Zora Zhiruo Wang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06664

### motivation
Multimodal agents use fixed neural tools despite their variable performance across tasks, limiting adaptability and accuracy.

### method
Proposes ToolMem, a learnable memory system that stores and retrieves tool capability summaries to enable dynamic, optimal tool selection.

### abstract
Agents utilizing tools powered by large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse tasks across text and visual modalities. Unlike traditional tools such as calculators, which give deterministic outputs, neural tools perform uncertainly across task scenarios. While different tools for a task may excel in varied scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and 28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios. Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by 21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

### When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning

**Authors:** Mi Luo, Zihui Xue, Alex Dimakis, Kristen Grauman
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06077

**motivation**

Addresses 'visual thinking drift' where Chain-of-Thought reasoning in video tasks generates hallucinated or biased narratives ungrounded in visual evidence.

**method**

Introduces Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a reinforcement learning framework that rewards reasoning traces verifiably grounded in actual video content.

**abstract**

Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

### Gaussian Embeddings: How JEPAs Secretly Learn Your Data Density

**Authors:** Randall Balestriero, Nicolas Ballas, Mike Rabbat, Yann LeCun
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05949

**motivation**

Reveals that the anti-collapse term in JEPAs implicitly learns data density, enabling probabilistic inference from self-supervised representations.

**method**

Shows that JEPA-trained models can compute sample probabilities in closed-form using the Jacobian, yielding a density estimator called JEPA-SCORE.

**abstract**

Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family (I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

### Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow

**Authors:** Ruyang Liu, Shangkun Sun, Haoran Tang, Ge Li, Wei Gao
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05836

**motivation**

Tackles redundancy in long-form video understanding exacerbated by limited context in multimodal LLMs and overreliance on semantic priors like CLIP.

**method**

Proposes Flow4Agent, which uses optical flow as a motion prior to optimize temporal granularity and prune redundant visual tokens efficiently.

**abstract**

Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper, we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding. Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

### Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics for Visual Reasoning and Comprehension

**Authors:** Jike Zhong, Yuxiang Lai, Xiaofeng Yang, Konstantinos Psounis
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05674

**motivation**

Bridges the gap between language and vision models in reasoning by addressing the lack of semantic context in standard vision transformer training.

**method**

Replaces random patch masking with object-level masked image modeling to encourage learning of global semantics and contextual visual relationships.

**abstract**

Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning

### Improving Chain-of-Thought Efficiency for Autoregressive Image Generation

**Authors:** Zeqi Gu, Markos Georgopoulos, Xiaoliang Dai, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Chu Wang, Felix Juefei-Xu, Kunpeng Li, Yujun Shi, Zecheng He, Zijian He, Jiawei Zhou, Abe Davis, Jialiang Wang
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05593

**motivation**

Reduces computational inefficiency and prompt contradictions caused by verbose Chain-of-Thought reasoning in autoregressive image generation.

**method**

Introduces ShortCoTI, a reinforcement learning framework that adaptively rewards concise CoT prompts while preserving image generation quality.

**abstract**

Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images.

### Are We Using the Right Benchmark: An Evaluation Framework for Visual Token Compression Methods

**Authors:** Chenfei Liao, Wensong Wang, Zichen Wen, Xu Zheng, Yiyu Wang, Haocong He, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Lutao Jiang, Xin Zou, Yuqian Fu, Bin Ren, Linfeng Zhang, Xuming Hu

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07143

**motivation**

Current benchmarks for visual token compression are mismatched and noisy, leading to unfair evaluations of compression methods.

**method**

Proposes VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework with data filtering to denoise benchmarks and enable fairer assessment of compression techniques.

**abstract**

Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at https://github.com/Chenfei-Liao/VTC-Bench.

### SaFeR-VLM: Toward Safety-aware Fine-grained Reasoning in Multimodal Models

**Authors:** Huahui Yi, Kun Wang, Qiankun Li, Miao Yu, Liang Lin, Gongli Xi, Hao Wu, Xuming Hu, Kang Li, Yang Liu

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06871

**motivation**

Multimodal reasoning models amplify safety risks during reasoning, and existing defenses fail to constrain the reasoning process itself.

**method**

Introduces SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned RL framework embedding safety into reasoning via curated data, reflective rollouts, structured rewards, and GRPO optimization.

**abstract**

Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

### SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals

**Authors:** Xuhang Chen, Zhifan Song, Deyi Ji, Shuo Gao, Lanyun Zhu

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06843

**motivation**

Existing multi-LLM debate methods ignore internal self-signals, causing redundancy and inefficiency in collaborative reasoning.

**method**

Presents SID, which uses model-level confidence and token-level attention to adaptively guide debate, enabling early exit and content compression.

**abstract**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available at~\href{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}{\texttt{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}}.

### Get RICH or Die Scaling: Profitably Trading Inference Compute for Robustness

**Authors:** Tavish McDonald, Bo Lei, Stanislav Fort, Bhavya Kailkhura, Brian Bartoldson

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06790

**motivation**

Test-time compute improves robustness only under limited attack settings; its value under gradient-based or multimodal attacks is unclear.

**method**

Proposes the RICH hypothesis: inference compute boosts robustness when models leverage compositional generalization from robustified training data.

**abstract**

Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks, resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH: attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

### DreamOmni2: Multimodal Instruction-based Editing and Generation

**Authors:** Bin Xia, Bohao Peng, Yuechen Zhang, Junjia Huang, Jiyang Liu, Jingyao Li, Haoru Tan, Sitong Wu, Chengyao Wang, Yitong Wang, Xinglong Wu, Bei Yu, Jiaya Jia

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06679

**motivation**

Current instruction-based editing and subject-driven generation lack support for multimodal inputs and abstract concepts.

**method**

Introduces DreamOmni2 with a data synthesis pipeline and a multimodal framework using index/position encoding and joint VLM training.

**abstract**

Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1) using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

### ToolMem: Enhancing Multimodal Agents with Learnable Tool Capability Memory

**Authors:** Yunzhong Xiao, Yangmin Li, Hewei Wang, Yunlong Tang, Zora Zhiruo Wang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06664

**motivation**

Multimodal agents use fixed neural tools despite their variable performance across tasks, limiting adaptability and accuracy.

**method**

Proposes ToolMem, a learnable memory system that stores and retrieves tool capability summaries to enable dynamic, optimal tool selection.

**abstract**

Agents utilizing tools powered by large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse tasks across text and visual modalities. Unlike traditional tools such as calculators, which give deterministic outputs, neural tools perform uncertainly across task scenarios. While different tools for a task may excel in varied scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and 28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios. Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by 21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

### NaViL: Rethinking Scaling Properties of Native Multimodal Large Language Models under Data Constraints

**Authors:** Changyao Tian, Hao Li, Gen Luo, Xizhou Zhu, Weijie Su, Hanming Deng, Jinguo Zhu, Jie Shao, Ziran Zhu, Yunpeng Liu, Lewei Lu, Wenhai Wang, Hongsheng Li, Jifeng Dai

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08565

**motivation**

Explores native end-to-end training of multimodal LLMs under data constraints to understand scaling properties and overcome limitations of compositional training.

**method**

Systematically studies design choices to find an optimal meta-architecture, reveals scaling correlations, and proposes NaViL with a cost-effective training recipe.

**abstract**

Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that, we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs. Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs. Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future study of native MLLMs.

### How to Teach Large Multimodal Models New Skills

**Authors:** Zhen Zhu, Yiming Gong, Yao Xiao, Yaoyao Liu, Derek Hoiem

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08564

**motivation**

Addresses catastrophic forgetting in large multimodal models when sequentially learning new skills without losing prior general abilities.

**method**

Identifies output token distribution shifts as a forgetting indicator and proposes two parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies that preserve held-out performance.

**abstract**

How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii) updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/LMM_CL

### MM-HELIX: Boosting Multimodal Long-Chain Reflective Reasoning with Holistic Platform and Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization

**Authors:** Xiangyu Zhao, Junming Lin, Tianhao Liang, Yifan Zhou, Wenhao Chai, Yuzhe Gu, Weiyun Wang, Kai Chen, Gen Luo, Wenwei Zhang, Junchi Yan, Hua Yang, Haodong Duan, Xue Yang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08540

**motivation**

Tackles the poor long-chain reflective reasoning capability of current MLLMs on complex, iterative multimodal problems.

**method**

Introduces MM-HELIX benchmark, generates reflective reasoning traces, and proposes Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) to unify offline and online learning.

**abstract**

While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability. Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable MLLMs.

### Better Together: Leveraging Unpaired Multimodal Data for Stronger Unimodal Models

**Authors:** Sharut Gupta, Shobhita Sundaram, Chenyu Wang, Stefanie Jegelka, Phillip Isola

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08492

**motivation**

Investigates whether unpaired multimodal data can enhance unimodal representation learning without requiring aligned data pairs.

**method**

Proposes UML, a modality-agnostic model that alternately processes unpaired inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters to exploit cross-modal structure.

**abstract**

Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image and audio.

### Looking to Learn: Token-wise Dynamic Gating for Low-Resource Vision-Language Modelling

**Authors:** Bianca-Mihaela Ganescu, Suchir Salhan, Andrew Caines, Paula Buttery

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08470

**motivation**

Aims to improve vision-language modeling under severe data constraints by enabling efficient, interpretable multimodal fusion.

**method**

Uses token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive cue fusion, feature modulation, channel attention, and contrastive objectives to maximize limited visual information utility.

**abstract**

Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3) auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision, favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words. While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability and performance even under severe constraints.

### ARES: Multimodal Adaptive Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Token-Level Entropy Shaping

**Authors:** Shuang Chen, Yue Guo, Yimeng Ye, Shijue Huang, Wenbo Hu, Haoxi Li, Manyuan Zhang, Jiayu Chen, Song Guo, Nanyun Peng

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08457

**motivation**

Solves the imbalance in reasoning effort—overthinking easy tasks and under-exploring hard ones—in multimodal reasoning models.

**method**

Introduces ARES, which uses window-averaged token entropy to detect difficulty and applies a two-stage training pipeline with adaptive entropy-based exploration control.

**abstract**

Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks. However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES, a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii) reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems under significantly lower inference costs.

### UniVideo: Unified Understanding, Generation, and Editing for Videos

**Authors:** Cong Wei, Quande Liu, Zixuan Ye, Qiulin Wang, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai, Wenhu Chen

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08377

**motivation**

Extends unified multimodal modeling from images to videos to support diverse generation and editing tasks under one framework.

**method**

Presents UniVideo with a dual-stream design: an MLLM for instruction understanding and an MMDiT for video synthesis, trained jointly across tasks.

**abstract**

Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08163

**motivation**

Mitigates over-thinking in reasoning models by adaptively balancing efficiency and performance across multimodal and code-based tasks.

**method**

Proposes ARM2, a reinforcement learning framework with length-aware optimization that integrates vision understanding and executable code to reduce token usage.

**abstract**

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking'' problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific, lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08049

**motivation**

Highlights the limitations of outcome-only reward models and advocates for fine-grained reasoning supervision in LLM alignment.

**method**

Surveys Process Reward Models (PRMs), covering data generation, model construction, and usage in RL and test-time scaling across multiple domains.

**abstract**

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability, conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models (ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

### Vision Language Models: A Survey of 26K Papers

**Authors:** Fengming Lin

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09586

**Motivation:**

Tracks evolving research trends in vision-language models across 26K papers to understand macro shifts in multimodal AI.

**Method:**

Analyzes titles/abstracts using a hand-crafted lexicon to assign topical labels and extract fine-grained research cues.

**Abstract:**

We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across 26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.

### PhysToolBench: Benchmarking Physical Tool Understanding for MLLMs

**Authors:** Zixin Zhang, Kanghao Chen, Xingwang Lin, Lutao Jiang, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Litao Guo, Yinchuan Li, Ying-Cong Chen

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09507

**Motivation:**

Assesses whether MLLMs truly understand physical tools—a key capability for embodied intelligence—currently lacking evaluation.

**Method:**

Introduces PhysToolBench, a VQA benchmark with 1,000+ image-text pairs testing tool recognition, understanding, and creation.

**Abstract:**

The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

### Multimodal Policy Internalization for Conversational Agents

**Authors:** Zhenhailong Wang, Jiateng Liu, Amin Fazel, Ritesh Sarkhel, Xing Fan, Xiang Li, Chenlei Guo, Heng Ji, Ruhi Sarikaya

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09474

**Motivation:**

Multimodal agents struggle with complex, lengthy policies; internalizing them improves adherence and reduces inference cost.

**Method:**

Proposes MPI and TriMPI: a three-stage training framework (pretraining, SFT, policy-aware RL) to internalize multimodal policies.

**Abstract:**

Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied. Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy, generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

### BLINK-Twice: You see, but do you observe? A Reasoning Benchmark on Visual Perception

**Authors:** Junyan Ye, Dongzhi Jiang, Jun He, Baichuan Zhou, Zilong Huang, Zhiyuan Yan, Hongsheng Li, Conghui He, Weijia Li

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09361

**Motivation:**

Existing reasoning benchmarks overemphasize language; visual reasoning requires deeper image-grounded observation.

**Method:**

Presents BLINK-Twice: a vision-centric benchmark with adversarial images, visual challenges, and annotated reasoning chains.

**Abstract:**

Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress, particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models. BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/PicoTrex/BLINK-Twice

### CapGeo: A Caption-Assisted Approach to Geometric Reasoning

**Authors:** Yuying Li, Siyi Qian, Hao Liang, Leqi Zheng, Ruichuan An, Yongzhen Guo, Wentao Zhang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09302

**Motivation:**

MLLMs fail at geometric reasoning due to poor diagram understanding, not logical reasoning ability.

**Method:**

Introduces CapGeo: uses textual captions of geometric figures to bridge vision and reasoning, plus CapGeo-Bench for evaluation.

**Abstract:**

Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs.

### Spotlight on Token Perception for Multimodal Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Siyuan Huang, Xiaoye Qu, Yafu Li, Yun Luo, Zefeng He, Daizong Liu, Yu Cheng

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09285

**Motivation:**

Multimodal RLVR ignores how visual perception varies across generated tokens, hurting reasoning quality.

**Method:**

Proposes VPPO, a policy gradient algorithm that reweights trajectories and updates only visually pivotal tokens using token perception.

**Abstract:**

While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models, with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales. Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LVLMs.

### Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs

**Authors:** Yumin Choi, Dongki Kim, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09201

**Motivation:**

Prompt optimization for MLLMs remains text-only, underutilizing non-textual modalities like images or videos.

**Method:**

Introduces MPO, a framework for joint multimodal prompt optimization using alignment-preserving updates and Bayesian selection.

**Abstract:**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images, videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

### FlexAC: Towards Flexible Control of Associative Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models

**Authors:** Shengming Yuan, Xinyu Lyu, Shuailong Wang, Beitao Chen, Jingkuan Song, Lianli Gao

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11190

**Motivation:**

Addresses the inflexibility of multimodal LLMs in balancing faithfulness and creativity due to uncontrolled associative reasoning.

**Method:**

Proposes FlexAC, a training-free framework that modulates associative reasoning by steering middle-layer representations using hallucination-derived vectors.

**Abstract:**

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.

### GIR-Bench: Versatile Benchmark for Generating Images with Reasoning

**Authors:** Hongxiang Li, Yaowei Li, Bin Lin, Yuwei Niu, Yuhang Yang, Xiaoshuang Huang, Jiayin Cai, Xiaolong Jiang, Yao Hu, Long Chen

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11026

**Motivation:**

Lacks a rigorous benchmark to evaluate reasoning alignment between image understanding and generation in unified multimodal models.

**Method:**

Introduces GIR-Bench, a benchmark assessing understanding-generation consistency, reasoning-based text-to-image generation, and multi-step reasoning in editing.

**Abstract:**

Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency (GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset, we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at \href{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}.

### ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution

**Authors:** Long Cui, Weiyun Wang, Jie Shao, Zichen Wen, Gen Luo, Linfeng Zhang, Yanting Zhang, Yu Qiao, Wenhai Wang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12793

**Motivation:**

Reduces high inference costs in MLLMs caused by excessive vision tokens from image inputs.

**Method:**

Uses multiple MLP connectors with varying compression ratios and a Visual Resolution Router to adapt token count based on semantic complexity.

**Abstract:**

Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs. In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch. Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

### SRUM: Fine-Grained Self-Rewarding for Unified Multimodal Models

**Authors:** Weiyang Jin, Yuwei Niu, Jiaqi Liao, Chengqi Duan, Aoxue Li, Shenghua Gao, Xihui Liu

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12784

**Motivation:**

Bridges the gap between strong visual understanding and weak visual generation in Unified Multimodal Models.

**Method:**

Introduces a self-rewarding framework where the model’s understanding module provides global-local rewards to improve its own generation.

**Abstract:**

Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts. This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward} ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a \textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82 to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation via self-rewarding.

### Beyond Seeing: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Tool-Enabled Image Perception, Transformation, and Reasoning

**Authors:** Xingang Guo, Utkarsh Tyagi, Advait Gosai, Paula Vergara, Ernesto Gabriel Hernández Montoya, Chen Bo Calvin Zhang, Bin Hu, Yunzhong He, Bing Liu, Rakshith Sharma Srinivasa

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12712

**Motivation:**

Existing benchmarks ignore MLLMs’ need to actively manipulate images as part of reasoning, treating vision as static.

**Method:**

Proposes IRIS, a benchmark evaluating MLLMs on tool-enabled perception, transformation, and reasoning across interactive visual-textual tasks.

**Abstract:**

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS, an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

### Reasoning in the Dark: Interleaved Vision-Text Reasoning in Latent Space

**Authors:** Chao Chen, Zhixin Ma, Yongqi Li, Yupeng Hu, Yinwei Wei, Wenjie Li, Liqiang Nie

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12603

**Motivation:**

Current multimodal reasoning relies on costly explicit steps requiring heavy annotation and causing latency.

**Method:**

Introduces IVT-LR, which performs interleaved vision-text reasoning implicitly in latent space via progressive multi-stage training.

**Abstract:**

Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.

### Vision Language Models Map Logos to Text via Semantic Entanglement in the Visual Projector

**Authors:** Sifan Li, Hongkai Chen, Yujun Cai, Qingwen Ye, Liyang Chen, Junsong Yuan, Yiwei Wang

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12287

**Motivation:**

VLMs hallucinate brand names from logos lacking visible text, revealing reliance on symbolic priors over visual evidence.

**Method:**

Analyzes logo hallucination via curated datasets and perturbations, identifying problematic projector subspaces and proposing targeted ablation for mitigation.

**Abstract:**

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode. Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

### Not in Sync: Unveiling Temporal Bias in Audio Chat Models

**Authors:** Jiayu Yao, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Rundong Cheng, Lingrui Mei, Baolong Bi, Zhen Xiong, Xueqi Cheng

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12185

**Motivation:**

Audio language models exhibit systematic errors in predicting event timestamps, especially in longer recordings.

**Method:**

Quantifies temporal bias using the Temporal Bias Index and controlled experiments, revealing consistent timing misalignments across models and events.

**Abstract:**

Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

### CompoDistill: Attention Distillation for Compositional Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs

**Authors:** Jiwan Kim, Kibum Kim, Sangwoo Seo, Chanyoung Park

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12184

**Motivation:**

Standard knowledge distillation fails to transfer visual perception abilities needed for compositional reasoning in MLLMs.

**Method:**

Proposes CompoDistill, which aligns student and teacher visual attention to better distill compositional visual reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:**

Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity, making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative, which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model (teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

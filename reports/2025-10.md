## When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning

### motivation
Addresses 'visual thinking drift' where Chain-of-Thought reasoning in video tasks generates hallucinated or biased narratives ungrounded in visual evidence.

### method
Introduces Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a reinforcement learning framework that rewards reasoning traces verifiably grounded in actual video content.

### abstract
Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

## Gaussian Embeddings: How JEPAs Secretly Learn Your Data Density

### motivation
Reveals that the anti-collapse term in JEPAs implicitly learns data density, enabling probabilistic inference from self-supervised representations.

### method
Shows that JEPA-trained models can compute sample probabilities in closed-form using the Jacobian, yielding a density estimator called JEPA-SCORE.

### abstract
Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family (I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

## Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow

### motivation
Tackles redundancy in long-form video understanding exacerbated by limited context in multimodal LLMs and overreliance on semantic priors like CLIP.

### method
Proposes Flow4Agent, which uses optical flow as a motion prior to optimize temporal granularity and prune redundant visual tokens efficiently.

### abstract
Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper, we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding. Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

## Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics for Visual Reasoning and Comprehension

### motivation
Bridges the gap between language and vision models in reasoning by addressing the lack of semantic context in standard vision transformer training.

### method
Replaces random patch masking with object-level masked image modeling to encourage learning of global semantics and contextual visual relationships.

### abstract
Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning

### motivation
Reduces computational inefficiency and prompt contradictions caused by verbose Chain-of-Thought reasoning in autoregressive image generation.

### method
Introduces ShortCoTI, a reinforcement learning framework that adaptively rewards concise CoT prompts while preserving image generation quality.

### abstract
Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images.
